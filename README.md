# Privacy Community Group Proposals

This repository is where the [Privacy CG](https://privacycg.github.io/)
discusses proposals for work that it has not yet taken up as
deliverables.

In other words, this is where the Privacy CG *incubates* new ideas.

## Proposal workflow

### How do I propose something?

1. **Join the group.** Before raising your proposal, please [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/join). This is to ensure that all contributions to our work are covered by the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).
2. **State your problem and make a rough proposal.** [File a new issue](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/new) in which you state the problem you’re trying to address and how you propose to address it. This can be a very rough idea, or something quite a bit more fleshed out. Please be explicit about your requirements, use cases, and rationale.

### What happens next?

3. **Evaluation and refinement.** As a community, we’ll discuss your proposal in the issue you raise. If there’s sufficient enthusiasm, we may ask you to write up and iterate on an [explainer](https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/explainers.md). The Chairs will help you spin up a repository for your explainer (and, eventually, your spec) to live in.
4. **Adoption as a deliverable.** When your proposal is sufficiently fleshed out and there are multiple [implementers](https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#implementer) in support of the idea, the group may decide to formally adopt your proposal as a deliverable. This is when we start working on a spec in parallel to the explainer.

### Standardization

5. **Editing and iteration.** The CG will iterate on the spec and explainer. We’ll discuss the deliverable, raise issues on it, hammer out the details, and consider feedback from any implementers who prototype the feature.
6. **Migration to the standards track.** When the feature is ready for standardization, we’ll migrate it from the CG to the most appropriate standards body (e.g. [WebAppSec](https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/), the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) or elsewhere).

## Resources for editors

When we spin up a repository in which you can work on an explainer and
spec, we'll use
[our template repository](https://github.com/privacycg/deliverable) as a
starting base.

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, all work and communication within the Privacy
CG is covered by the
[W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
